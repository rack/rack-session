# Rack::Session

Session management implementation for Rack.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/rack/rack-session/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rack/rack-session/actions?workflow=Test)

## Usage

In your `config.ru`:

``` ruby
# config.ru

require 'rack/session'
use Rack::Session::Cookie,
  :domain => 'mywebsite.com',
  :path => '/',
  :expire_after => 3600*24,
  :secret => '**unique secret key**'
```

Usage follows the standard outlined by `rack.session`, i.e.:

``` ruby
class MyApp
  def call(env)
    session = env['rack.session']

    # Set some state:
    session[:key] = "value"
  end
end
```

### Compatibility

`rack-session` code used to be part of Rack, but it was extracted in Rack v3 to this gem. The v1 release of this gem is compatible with Rack v2, and the v2 release of this gem is compatible with Rack v3+. That means you can add `gem "rack-session"` to your application and it will be compatible with all versions of Rack.
